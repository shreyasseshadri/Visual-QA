## Detailed Course plan
I would recommend to follow these links.
- Basic ML
    - [python programming net-This is a really good website containing Explanations and implementains of ML basics.Follow all the steps.](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)
    - Andrew NG Coursera
    - A-Z ML by udemy
    - See sessions from 3-12 in slack channel
- Convolutional Neural Networks
    - [See python programming net for CNN part - containing code in Tensorflow](https://pythonprogramming.net/cnn-tensorflow-convolutional-nerual-network-machine-learning-tutorial/)
    - Deep learning Course by AndrewNG(cover only the CNN part for now) 
    - see session 13 in slack
    - [cs231n course link to CNN](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
- Word Emmbeddings
    - [Word Embedding walk through](https://towardsdatascience.com/word-embeddings-exploration-explanation-and-exploitation-with-code-in-python-5dac99d5d795)
- LSTM
    - [Blog on LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
    - [python programing net-Walkthrough of LSTM tf code](https://pythonprogramming.net/rnn-tensorflow-python-machine-learning-tutorial/)
- Tensorflow
    - See python programing net links from above.
    
Emphasise more on implementation side of things.The basic ML part try to understand the theory properly.
