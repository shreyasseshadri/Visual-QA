## Detailed Course plan
I would recommend to follow these links along with going through the IE ML SMP Slack Channel.<br>
[Slack invite Link for IE ML SMP](https://join.slack.com/t/iemlsmp/shared_invite/enQtNDU0NDQ1Nzg3NzI4LTA5MTU4NWU0YmI2NmI0ZThiNzM3ZGM1YzhmZWEwMDEyNGQ2NTViYTc0NzBiZTI3NWZlMDAyZDcxYzVhNWVmMWM) 
- Basic ML
    - [python programming net-This is a really good website containing Explanations and implementains of ML basics.Follow all the steps.](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)
    - Andrew NG Coursera
    - A-Z ML by udemy
    - See sessions from 3-12 in slack channel
- Convolutional Neural Networks
    - [See python programming net for CNN part - containing code in Tensorflow](https://pythonprogramming.net/cnn-tensorflow-convolutional-nerual-network-machine-learning-tutorial/)
    - Deep learning Course by AndrewNG(cover only the CNN part for now) 
    - see session 13 in slack

Emphasise more on implementation side of things.The basic ML part try to understand the theory properly.
